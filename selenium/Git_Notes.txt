GIT - It is a free open source source version management system.

To work on this we have to have git in our local and GITHUB(which is a central repository where other prople can download our code work on it.)

Once the setup is done with github, create your new repository

you can do pull, push everything with commands or different tools(Tortoise git, Eclipse has it's own git plugin[EGIT], Intellij git) but as a basic thing we should know few commands that will help you in interviews also.

Use this link "https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html" where all basic git commands clearly mentioned.

our new repository is ready and create any folder in your file explorer and open cmd there and tell who you are by giving following commands

--------->git config --global user.name "Kanyakuamri"
--------->git config --global user.email "kanyakumari950@gmail.com" //--global is useful that we can access git hub from any global location.

--------->git init //Initilaize it as git repository
//it is mandatory that if we give this command git will create it's own .git repository to store local code and it's hidden file.

If we want to commit our code to github we have to add our files to "staging" from staging we can commit our code to github.

--------->git commit -m "my first commit" //-m stands for commit message and then we have to give the commit message inside quotes.

Once all code is committed we have to push our code to git hub that means remote git repository. We have setup a connection from local to remote git repository 

--------->git remote add origin https://github.com/kanyathoughts/GitDemo.git //we have registered origin with the given repository (GitDemo) and we have done the setup from local to remote repository

--------->git push origin master (we have to push the code to origin, master is the main branch)
