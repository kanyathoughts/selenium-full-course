	 * Let say we have implemented one stand alone project and every thing inside one project
	 * But let say one element properties got changed so your entire test will fail to avoid that we have introduced page object model
	 * in this we can create multiple classes which can hold only locators based on pages and 
	 * if we update in one class file it's going to update in all places and we don't need to go inside every test case and update.
